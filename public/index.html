    <div class="bio">I am a second year student enrolled in a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, at Concordia
        University located
        in Montreal. My objective to apply for an internship is to gain more practice and professional experience in my
        field
        of study. My goal is to work in a high paying job after my University graduation.

        <h1>Bio.</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm a second year computer science student at Concordia University, and I'm thrilled to be here! My
            passion for technology
            has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, and I've always known that computer science was
            the field for me.
            My interest in artificial intelligence has been growing rapidly over the past few years, and I'm eager to
            explore this field
            more in-depth.
            <br><br>
            At Concordia, I'm working hard to develop my skills in software development, and I feel like I'm making real
            progress.
            I've taken a number of courses that have helped me build a strong foundation in programming and computer
            science, and I'm
            constantly learning new things about this exciting field. I'm also very active in student organizations and
            clubs that focus
            on technology, and I love the opportunities I have to connect with other students and professionals who
            share my passions.
            <br><br>
            Overall, I'm grateful for the opportunities I have to grow and learn at Concordia, and I'm excited to see
            where my passion
            for technology and AI will take me in the future. I'm eager to work on cutting-edge projects and to develop
            new and innovative
            technologies that will help shape the future of our world. I'm confident that I have the skills and drive to
            succeed in this
            field, and I'm looking forward to the journey ahead!
